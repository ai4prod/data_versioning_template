# Python Test


Folder for Data test

# How it works


### data_version_test_dataset

Inside this folder you need to create test that are general. You can have 2 type of test.

- general test agnostic to task

These tests are **independent** on which task you are trying(classification, segmentation, ...)

- task specific

These tests are **dependant** on task. So keep here test that are general to task. 


### data_version_test_dataset

Inside this folder you need to create test specific you your data. So test that you need to use only for this particular kind of data
